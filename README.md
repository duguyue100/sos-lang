# sos-lang: Shell on Steroids

I hate shell scripts. They are powerful, they are useful, they are messy.
Really? I have to specify which shell program I want to use in the shebang?

When I think of something like this, I go back to Python, a much more capable
scripting language. It feels like home. But, which Python? And, I have to
install packages for this? It's acceptable and only acceptable.

Therefore, I want a simple programming language that has the following features:

- Can compile as executable so I can carry it anywhere.
- No crazy shell syntax.
- Doesn't have to be a fully featured general purpose language, I'm not taking over the world.
- Can take over the scripting jobs I need.
- Help me learn LLVM in the process.

This is it. I'm not sure how much time I can spend on this.
But every time I have to spend time writing another shell script, I will think about this project.
